STEP-BY-STEP FILE SAVING:
==========================

1. Create main folder: C:\xampp\htdocs\tourism_guide\

2. Save root files directly in tourism_guide folder:
   - index.php              (Now with FREE OpenStreetMap!)
   - login.php
   - logout.php
   - destination.php        (Now with FREE map view!)
   - README.md              (Explains FREE mapping!)
   - INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md  (NO API KEY setup needed!)
   - FILE_STRUCTURE.txt

3. Create "config" folder and save inside it:
   - database.php           (NO API KEY configuration needed!)

4. Create "admin" folder and save inside it:
   - dashboard.php
   - destinations.php
   - add_destination.php    (FREE map coordinate picker!)
   - edit_destination.php
   - categories.php
   - routes.php             (FREE route calculation!)
   - users.php

5. Create "uploads" folder with subfolders:
   - destinations/ (subfolder) - Images stored FREE locally
   - categories/ (subfolder)
   These will store uploaded images automatically (no cloud costs!)

6. Import database:
   - Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
